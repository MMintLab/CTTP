# CTTP
We introduce a contrastive self-supervised learning approach that represents tactile feedback across different sensor types. Our method utilizes paired tactile data—where two distinct sensors, in our case Soft Bubbles and GelSlims, grasp the same object in the same configuration—to learn a unified latent representation.

# Dataset
We use Touch2Touch Dataset.
